            <p> My name is Suraj Budhathoki. I moved from Nepal to the states about 10 years ago. I graduated from University of North Texas with Bachelors in Information Systems. </p>
             <p>   After college, i started working as an operations coordinator for Freedom Park.  I learned a lot from the business side and wanted to use my knowledge and apply in a more technical environment going forward. </p>
        <p>    I am currently taking part in the TEKsystems Full Stack Web Development bootcamp and am excited about having an opportunity to do some hands-on coding. This is a great opportunity for me to become a better coder and learn more about web development. I'm also looking forward to participate in various projects and expand my portfolio.
